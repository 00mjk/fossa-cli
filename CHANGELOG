## Versioning policy

This versioning policy only applies for versions below 1.0.0. We will develop a separate versioning policy after the 1.0.0 release.

We generally follow semantic versioning, but semantic versioning does not specify pre-1.0.0 behavior. Here is how `fossa` pre-1.0.0 releases will work:

- Any update that creates a breaking change (i.e. a change that causes a previously working configuration to fail) will bump the minor version.
- All other updates will bump the patch version.
- Preview, beta, and other special releases will have a pre-release identifer in the semantic version, and will be marked as pre-release on GitHub Releases.

## Version history

Major breaking changes and new features will be recorded here. For a much more detailed automated changelog, see the changelogs accompanying each GitHub Release.

### 0.4.1

#### New features
- Managed Builds are now supported: you no longer need to have a corresponding Git project within FOSSA to upload build results.

#### Breaking changes
- By default, new projects will use Managed Builds (i.e. their fetcher will be `custom`). This is different from the original default, which set the fetcher to be `git`. This will break your configuration if you do not explicitly set the project's fetcher.
