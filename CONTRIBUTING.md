## Adding language integrations

See [Adding New Languages](docs/integrations/adding-new-languages.md).

## Running tests

Since `fossa` relies on having the correct build tools in your local environment, running `fossa` tests requires being able to successfully build all projects in `test/fixtures/`. To provide these tools and prevent you from clobbering your local machine, we have run tests in a Docker container defined at `test/Dockerfile`.
